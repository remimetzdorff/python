# MAJOR BUG FIXES
	- Pluto's orbit is fine too but again position is a bit wrong (improvement since Pluto is treated as an asteroid and no longer as a planet)

# CLEAN UP
	- cleanup the code
	- check for python good practices

# EASE OF USE
	- French version of comments

# IMPROVMENTS
	- list to plot all object from a set of planets
	- file creator with all coordinates for a body from start to stop, with step
	- natural satellites
	- spacecrafts

# PRESENTATION
	- display features: to show what this thing can do (add Halley)
	- tutorial (notebook)
	- documentation

# MISC
	- animate or not
	- choose frame of reference

# DONE
	- asteroid orbits are right but position is so wrong: check for parameters. Use old version resources to compare procedures
	- Use date converters defined in the beginning for the whole program
	- add comets from small body database
	- add function to access all available bodies: not a function, just a constant
	- 3D example of Halley or other asteroid with non-zero inclination
