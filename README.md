This repository gathers all my useful general purpose python modules. More durable packages will be in here too.

When a new module is added to this repository, PYTHONPATH variable needs to be changed. To do so, change the export PYTHONPATH part of ~/.zshrc file.
Don't forget about __init__.py files.
